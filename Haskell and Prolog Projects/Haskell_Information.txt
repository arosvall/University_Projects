Assignment One, BasicHaskell.lhs
This was the first experience with Haskell and is a basic Haskell assignment
Some functions were needed to be completed with direct recursion:
positives, oddElts, union, occursOnce
Other functions were tail recursive
isPrime, longest, allPositions, convert
Then a map was implemented and letter frequencies were counted
There are tests for this in the code

Assignment Two, MoreHaskell.lhs
This was the second haskell assignment and thus more difficult than the first. 
A large section of this assignment was using the haskell features of higher order functions, list comphrehensions
The next section was on Binary Search Trees
Then Graph Algorithms using sets
All of which needed to have tests as well.
