These projects were for a second year Computer Graphics paper. The projects were all written in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio
Project one was the introduction to C++, which was basic loading of a mesh, moving the mesh with rotations
Project two was an extension of the first project, which involved mesh deformation
Project three was implementing a boid pack, using various measures to get the boids to mimic the movements of bird packs, and involved collision detection as well
Project four was a light based assignment which worked with shading, loading shapes correctly, and reflections
