This was the second C based assignment
It is a simple noughts and crosses game
In the first task, the table is drawn and the players alternate between where they put their icon, X or O, which is decided by the character of the playing player. The table is just a single row
The second task elaborates on the first task, adding checks to see if the board has a character already in that spot. The players define the table size
In the final task there is a computer player against the human player, which makes decisions based on random number generation to find an empty spot on the board.
