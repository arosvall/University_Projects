This was the fourth C assignment worked on. it is a replication of the 2048 game in a letter based format known as the K game
Some code was provided for this assignment:
add_random_tile()
The rest of the code was written by myself
This consists of the main file, the k header file and the k.c file where the header methods were implemented. This was the first experience of multi-file programming in C
