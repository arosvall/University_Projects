This assignment was a series of simple C tasks, starting with a random number generator that took an input from a user and said if the random number was larger, smaller or equal
From there, the difficulty increased from informing the player if they lost the game and guessed wrong, allowing the player to keep playing as many rounds as they wanted, using macros in place of variables, and finally giving multiple tries to get the number right
This was the first C based assignment I completed at University. 
Each file is name tx, where that is the task number within the assignment. higher numbers denote higher difficulty in coding
