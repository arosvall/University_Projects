These assignments were two introductions to cyphers written in C
The first assignment, L1_decode and L1_encode, was a simple cypher which encoded and decoded using a modified Caesar cypher
The second assignment, L2_crack, was a program which performed frequency analysis on a block of cyphertext to determine through brute force how many keds were used to encode the text
The criteria for L2_crack was: 1. For each possible number of keys, i 2. Split the cyphertext into i sub-cyphertexts and apply frequency analysis to each of them 3. Recomine the sub-cyphertexts to form the entire ‘partly decoded’ text for each nominated number of keys and output the result
